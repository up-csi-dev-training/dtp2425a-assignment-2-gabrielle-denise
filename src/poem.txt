"Maroon"
by Taylor Swift

When the morning came we were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend.
"How'd we end up on the floor anyway?" You say
"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top ros√©," that's how
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancin' with
In Taft, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was a big ahh cloud
The burgundy on my T-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark you saw on my collarbone, the rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home, so scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came, we
Were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
We knew this could never end.
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you no matter what
The rubies that I gave up
